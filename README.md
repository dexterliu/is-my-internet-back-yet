is-my-internet-back-yet
=======================

Internet service at my apartment (Time Warner *cough*) has been absurdly unreliable lately.  So, I leave and go do things, all while wondering if internet has come back at my apartment yet.  

This will send me a text message via Twilio when the internet is back.  


### Setup
Copy twilio_secrets.default.rb to twilio_secrets.rb.  Fill it in with your twilio credentials.
Change permissions to make tellme.rb executeable

Use Ruby 1.9.3. I mean, really.
